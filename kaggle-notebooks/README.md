# Kaggle Notebooks

Welcome to the Kaggle Notebooks folder within my ML Projects repository! In this directory, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files that I've created while working on various Kaggle competitions and data analysis projects.

## Introduction

This folder contains Jupyter Notebook files related to my Kaggle activities. Kaggle is a platform for data science and machine learning competitions, and I use this space to share the notebooks I've created while participating in competitions, exploring datasets, and conducting data analysis.

Feel free to explore these notebooks to gain insights into the techniques and approaches I've used for Kaggle projects.

## Notebooks

Here's a list of the Kaggle notebooks available in this folder:

1. [Capuchin Bird Audio Classification](capuchinbird-audio-classification.ipynb): A notebook that determines if a particular audio file includes Capuchin Bird Audio or not. This notebook was made for the HP Unlocked Challenge 3 (PS: I wasn't able to get to satisfying results, so colaboration is welcome)

Each notebook is accompanied by a link to the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file, allowing you to delve into the details of the analysis and solutions.

## Usage

You can use this folder for the following purposes:

- **Exploration**: Browse through the Kaggle notebooks to understand how I approached specific Kaggle challenges or conducted data analysis on interesting datasets.
- **Learning**: Use these notebooks as educational resources to learn about various data science and machine learning techniques.
- **Collaboration**: If you find a notebook that interests you or if you'd like to collaborate on a Kaggle competition, feel free to reach out and discuss ideas or contributions.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions, improvements, or would like to collaborate on a Kaggle project, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration and knowledge sharing are encouraged.

Happy exploring and learning in the world of Kaggle!
